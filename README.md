Enhance Chat Integration with Contextual Transformation on FDC3
From @sarahstone-cosaic (Finsemble)

Business Problem
Facilitate communications between Buy-side and Sell-side by initiating a message to an existing chat group from an order in your order blotter. Use FDC3 intents to initiate a chat from an order on a blotter. Create a service to transform the “broker” or “instrument” on blotter to correct the chat name for that user. Potential to leverage Legend project to store and manage translations.

The buy-side would take advantage of options to chat for a given order to a variety of targets e.g. internal execution desk, users supervisor and internal team.

Expected features
Send order from blotter to correct chat room based on security or contra broker
Multiplexing request to send to chat and open chart
Useful apps, systems, projects, technologies, libraries and datasets
